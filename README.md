# Push-Away Spigot Plugin

## Overview
The Push-Away plugin enhances your Minecraft server by allowing players to push others away when they are within a certain range. The plugin uses a custom wand to trigger the push action, and it comes with customizable settings to suit your server's needs. Players will be launched away from each other, creating dynamic interactions.

## Features
- **Push-Away Mechanism**: Pushes players within a specified range when triggered by right-clicking with a wand.
- **Customizable Wand**: Customize the wand's material, name, lore, and usage.
- **Cooldown**: Set a cooldown period between uses to prevent spamming the push effect.
- **Sound Effects**: Configurable sounds for both when a player is pushed and when the player pushes others away.
- **Messages**: Fully customizable messages to enhance player experience.
